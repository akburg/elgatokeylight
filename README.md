# Elgato Key Light Air Automation on Mac OS
Automate Elgato Key Light Air to switch on automatically when you join a Google Meet or Zoom call (or any app that in-fact uses a camera stream on a Mac OS) and switches it off when the stream ends.

I've found it a hassle to remember to switch my lights on and off as I join various video calls throughout the day.  This bash script (works for Mac OS Monterey 12.x or later) monitors the Mac OS stream log and runs a curl command to activate the lights.
## Configuration
See `config.example.sh` for an example of how to configure the script.  You can copy this file to `config.sh` and edit it to suit your needs.

## Running the script
### Running the script and testing if everything works

You can run the script using Terminal, download the .sh file, edit it and run:

`sh autolights.sh`

and this will start to monitor your stream log.  Open any app that uses your web camera, maybe **Photo Booth** and see if your light(s) come on.  If they do not, check that you have entered the correct IP address for your light(s).  Easiest way to identify the IP address is to use the **Elgato Control Center** utility > **Key light settings** > and note the IP address for each light.

### Executing the shell script automatically

If (like me) you prefer to run the bash script every time you start-up up your Mac to avoid starting it manually, you can goto **Users and Groups** > **Login Items** tab > and plus in your bash script.  You can check the _Hide_ button won't show the terminal window.

## How it works
### Monitoring camera stream on Mac OS 12.x (Monterey) or later

`log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.UVCExtension" and composedMessage contains "Post PowerLog"'`

This essentially monitors the stream log on Mac OS and filters out any video capture on Mac OS 12.X (Monterey) or later, for older versions of Mac OS, check out the good work at: https://gist.github.com/jptoto/3b2197dd652ef13bd7f3cab0f2152b19 for that.

### Checking camera stream status
`log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.UVCExtension" and composedMessage contains "Post PowerLog"' --last 1h | awk '/VDCAssistant_Power_State/ {state = $NF} END {print state}'`

This will check the last hour of the stream log and check the status of the camera stream.  If the camera stream is active, it will return `On;` and if it is inactive, it will return `Off;`. This is used to key the light from quickly toggling on and off if the camera is rapidly switching such as during teams initialization.

### Turning the Engato Key Light Air On and Off

`curl --location --request PUT 'http://<light IP address>:9123/elgato/lights' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{"lights":[{"brightness":40,"temperature":162,"on":1}],"numberOfLights":1}'`

May you see the light! ðŸ”¦ ðŸ˜†
